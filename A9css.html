        Mother can be defined as the source of joy and happiness in a person’s life. She is the one who from the birth of 
        the child to his old age stands beside him in every phase of life. There’s a saying that God cannot be everywhere so he 
    created Mother.
    A Mother does everything selflessly for her child and without any condition. There the love of a Mother is known to 
    be Unconditional. The way she manages my family with utter dedication and devotion is inspiring. The relationship with
     my mother is something very hard to explain.
