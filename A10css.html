  The pomegranate (Punica granatum) is a fruit-bearing deciduous shrub in the family Lythraceae, subfamily Punicoideae, 
  that grows between 5 and 10 m (16 and 33 ft) tall. The pomegranate is rich in symbolic and mythological associations in 
  many cultures.
  Young pomegranate tree in Side, TurkeyThe pomegranate was thought to have originated from Afghanistan and Iran before being introduced and exported to other 
  parts of Asia, Africa, and Europe.[4][5][6] It was introduced into Spanish America in the late 16th century and into 
  California by Spanish settlers in 1769.[7] They are widely cultivated throughout West Asia and Caucasus region, South
   Asia, Central Asia, north and tropical Africa, the drier parts of Southeast Asia, and the Mediterranean Basin.[7] The
    fruit is typically in season in the Southern Hemisphere from March to May, and in the Northern Hemisphere from 
    September to February.[8][9]
  As intact sarcotestas or as juice, pomegranates are used in baking, cooking, juice blends, meal garnishes, smoothies, 
  and alcoholic beverages, such as cocktails and wine.</p>

      An apple is a round, edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus spp., among them the domestic or orchard apple; 
      Malus domestica). Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. 
      The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found. Apples have been 
      grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe and were introduced to North America by European colonists. Apples 
      have religious and mythological significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek, and European Christian 
      tradition.
      Apples grown from seed tend to be very different from those of their parents, and the resultant fruit frequently 
      lacks desired characteristics. For commercial purposes, including botanical evaluation, apple cultivars are 
      propagated by clonal grafting onto rootstocks. Apple trees grown without rootstocks tend to be larger and much 
      slower to fruit after planting. Rootstocks are used to control the speed of growth and the size of the resulting 
      tree, allowing for easier harvesting.
      There are more than 7,500 cultivars of apples.[3] Different cultivars are bred for various tastes and uses, 
      including cooking, eating raw, and cider or apple juice production. Trees and fruit are prone to fungal, bacterial, 
      and pest problems, which can be controlled by a number of organic and non-organic means. In 2010, the fruit's genome
       was sequenced as part of research on disease control and selective breeding in apple production.
